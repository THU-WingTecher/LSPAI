1. Generate DIVERSE test cases so that maximize coverage of the given focal methods.
2. You should Step-by-step Reasoning following below chain of thought.
    a. Interpret given condition one by one, if definition/reference is given for the term under coniditon, utilize it to help your understanding.
    b. Create Example that satisfy the condition to empower your understanding.
    c. generate code or input tokens that match your understanding.
    d. move to next condition 
3. DO NOT Re-write focal method in unit test codes, assume that method is exist.
4. After reasoning, generate unit test case follow below unit test format. Final Code should be wrapped by ```.
